# OCD-patient-data-visualization

This project was developed during the course Programmiertes Entwerfen 2 in the Interaction Design program (2nd semester) at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd.

I Created a data-driven visualization that communicates key insights from a dataset using code. I chose the topic Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and based the project on a dataset of 1,500 fictional patient entries from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data.
